Why use Glial?

BUILD APPLICATIONS QUICKLY
Many common components are included: translation tools, database access, code profiling, encryption, validation, and more.

USE SPECIFIC LIBRARIES AND TOOLS
Extending existing components and adding new libraries is very easy.

WRITE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
Uses the GNU/GPL license, so you can use and modify it for commercial purposes.

A VERY FAST FRAMEWORK
Benchmarking a framework is hard and rarely reflects the real world, but Glial is very efficient and carefully optimized for real world usage.

GOOD DEBUGGING AND PROFILING TOOLS
Simple and effective tools help identify and solve performance issues quickly.

KNOW WHAT THE FRAMEWORK IS DOING
Very well commented code and a simple routing structure makes it easy to understand what is happening.

WORK WITH OBJECTS AND CLASSES
This is an OOP framework that is extremely DRY. Everything is built using strict PHP 5 classes and objects.

WRITE YOUR OWN CODE
There are no code generators and endless configuration files, so setting up is fast and easy.

COMMUNITY SUPPORT
A very active community forum and IRC channel means that most questions are answered very quickly.
