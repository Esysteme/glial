<h2>Requirement ?</h2>

1. modrewrite of Apache
1. PHP 5.5.*

<h2>How to install?</h2>


<h3>To create a new project</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/Esysteme/glial-new">Have a look on glial-new</a>

<h3>To install as a library</h3>

Simply add a dependency on glial/glial to your project's composer.json file if you use Composer to manage the dependencies of your project. Here is a minimal example of a composer.json file that just defines a development-time dependency on Glial 2.1:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "glial/glial": "2.1.*"
    }
}
```

<h2>Why use Glial?</h2>

<h3>BUILD APPLICATIONS QUICKLY</h3>
Many common components are included: translation tools, database access, code profiling, encryption, validation, and more.

<h3>USE SPECIFIC LIBRARIES AND TOOLS</h3>
Extending existing components and adding new libraries is very easy.

<h3>WRITE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS</h3>
Uses the GNU/GPL license, so you can use and modify it for commercial purposes.

<h3>A VERY FAST FRAMEWORK</h3>
Benchmarking a framework is hard and rarely reflects the real world, but Glial is very efficient and carefully optimized for real world usage.

<h3>GOOD DEBUGGING AND PROFILING TOOLS</h3>
Simple and effective tools help identify and solve performance issues quickly.

<h3>KNOW WHAT THE FRAMEWORK IS DOING</h3>
Very well commented code and a simple routing structure makes it easy to understand what is happening.

<h3>WORK WITH OBJECTS AND CLASSES</h3>
This is an OOP framework that is extremely DRY. Everything is built using strict PHP 5 classes and objects.

<h3>WRITE YOUR OWN CODE</h3>
There are no code generators and endless configuration files, so setting up is fast and easy.
